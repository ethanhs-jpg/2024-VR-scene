This resource offers a starting point to learn more about the elements of a 3D scene, including introductory knowledge on multidimensional media, as well as managing media in a way which promotes the FAIR principles.

The developing resources will cover issues such as:

- Polygonal meshes 
- Coordinate systems and transformations (basics of rotation/translation and scaling)
- Cameras
- Controllers
- Navigation/teleportation
- Lighting
- Ray casting and collision detection
- Shaders

By the end of this session you are expected to be able to:

- Define the different types of multidimensional media.
- Understand the basics of 3D scenes,
and how to access information on their implementation on a Game Engine or 3D library.
