- What is a polygonal mesh?

A polygonal mesh is the collection of vertices, edges, and faces used to make up the shape and the contour of a 3D object. It is the oldest form of geometry representation used in computer graphics to create objects in 3D space.

- What are the elements of a polygonal mesh, including textures and materials?

Vertices – These are points in 3D space that comprise a face and store the x, y, and z coordinates information.
Edges – These are lines that connect two vertices to each other.
Faces – These are the closed set of edges where a three-edged face forms a triangle mesh, and a four-edged face forms a quad. 
They contain surface information used for lighting and shadows.
Surfaces – These are groups of connected polygons that define different elements of the mesh. 
Polygons – These are a set of faces (formed usually when you have more than four connected vertices).


- How do the elements of a polygonal meshes affect the performance of a VR environment?

High Poly:
pros:
- Detail
- Close up
- High Resolution
cons:
- More processing power

Low Poly:
pros:
- Simple
- Stylised 
- Light
cons:
- Limited detail


VR/AR prefers Low Poly
- Efficient 
- Smaller file size
- Less lag/delays
- Dynamic
