## Polygonal mesh

A polygonal mesh is the collection of vertices, edges, and faces used to make up the shape and the contour of a 3D object. It is the oldest form of geometry representation used in computer graphics to create objects in 3D space.

## Elements of a polygonal mesh, including textures and materials

- *Vertices* – These are points in 3D space that comprise a face and store the x, y, and z coordinates information.
- *Edges* – These are lines that connect two vertices to each other.
- *Faces* – These are the closed set of edges where a three-edged face forms a triangle mesh, and a four-edged face forms a quad. They contain surface information used for lighting and shadows.
- *Surfaces* – These are groups of connected polygons that define different elements of the mesh. 
- *Polygons* – These are a set of faces (formed usually when you have more than four connected vertices).


## Performance of a VR environment

### High Poly:

*Pros:*

- Detail
- Close up
- High Resolution
cons:
- More processing power

### Low Poly:

*Pros:*

- Simple
- Stylised 
- Light
cons:
- Limited detail


**VR/AR prefers Low Poly**

- Efficient 
- Smaller file size
- Less lag/delays
- Dynamic
